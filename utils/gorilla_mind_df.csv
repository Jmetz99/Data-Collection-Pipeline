Focus without the jitters. Concentration without anxiety. Efficiency without the counter-productive crash. For those averse to caffeinated beverages, or stimulant-based products in general, this will be perfect for you. Gorilla Mind Smooth is our stimulant-free version of Gorilla Mind, providing a smoother, less extreme level of energy, but still maximizing the intense level of focus and heightened mental clarity that Gorilla Mind is renowned for. In general, you can expect clear headed mental clarity, as well as improved information retention, mood elevation, creativity, productivity and concentration. Gorilla Mind Smooth is not designed to jack your brain into high gear. Smooth is purely meant to enhance cognitive function and overall mental performance while enhancing your overall well-being.  Gorilla Mind Smooth can also double as pre-workout to give a big strength boost through the effects of acetylcholine. Recent formulas have worked very well at doing this but with further alterations to the formula there are more cholinergic agents at higher dosages. This increase in choline will help enhance the intracellular communication between the brain and nervous system, which is why it can be a great stack on top of your heavily dosed Gorilla Mode pre-workout for greater strength output.

Glycerol significantly enhances pumps and performance by hyper-hydrating the muscle with water. If you drink a lot of water with nothing else, the fall in osmolarity in your body stimulates the kidneys to remove most of the excess water within an hour. If you add glycerol to the water, this prevents the drop in osmolarity and can extend the hyper-hydration effect in your muscles by up to four hours. By adding Glycerol to your pre-workout, you can hold upwards of an extra liter of water via this hyper-hydrating effect. Hydration is one of the most critical factors when it comes to performance.

You can expect: Appetite Suppression, increased fat loss and a boost of energy.  Rauwolscine works by inhibiting the alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the body. This will cause the body to release the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which can help prevent the creation of new fat tissue.  These Alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are very prominent in stubborn areas of the body like the inner thighs and abdominal areas, which makes the inhibition of those receptors very helpful during a diet. In addition, Rauwolscine can help during a diet by potentially reducing your appetite and increasing energy throughout the day. If you've dieted before, you'll know the biggest barriers are feeling hungry and lacking energy. In a calorie deficit, your body doesn't receive its usual amount of food resulting in lower energy and the release of the hunger hormone, ghrelin. Combat this with Rauwolscine during your next cut or diet. ",[],0.0,None

Gorilla Mode EAA’s can be taken before, during, or after your workouts and will aid with muscle protein synthesis, muscle recovery and muscle building.

GORILLA MODE ENERGY TO GO,gorilla-mode-energy-to-go,3abf0f3a-68db-4087-9ef5-3768957b3353,,"Gorilla Mode ""Energy"" is our aggressively dosed turnkey energy formula designed for maxed out performance and intense focus.  It is branded as a pre-workout, but it more broadly serves as an all around high potency energy formula.  You can expect a very clean boost in mental clarity, productivity, focus and energy with this product.  Gorilla Mode ""Energy"" contains a massive dose of carefully chosen synergistic stimulants and nootropics.  This product is designed specifically for energy and mental sharpness, so it does not contain any Nitric Oxide precursors, plasma expanders, or volumizing agents like Gorilla Mode and Gorilla Mode Nitric do.  As it is a pure energy formula, it can be stacked alongside our stimulant-free pre-workout Gorilla Mode Nitric to create an extremely potent all around pre-workout.  Just like all of our other products, look at the label and compare it to your current pre-workout.
