    "Description": "α2 AM - Named α2 AM because one of the main vectors it works through is the antagonism of the α2 adrenergic receptors, and it is most effectively used in the morning (AM), ideally on an empty stomach before fasted cardio or training if you want to maximize its fat burning potential. This is our stimulant based fat burner.  Rauwolscine is only 1 component of the comprehensive α2 AM formula, which works via several different vectors to provide a substantially higher level of fat loss and appetite suppression.  α2 AM might even be preferred over a full dose of Gorilla Mode for some of you stim fiends that like the drive your head through the wall energy (it is designed to be more of an adrenaline hit), so it could be used as a makeshift stim blend to stack with Gorilla Mode Nitric to get maxed out mental focus, stim junky energy, fat loss, and ultimate performance via the Nitric. Do not combine with Gorilla Mode, Gorilla Mode Energy, or Rauwolscine. ",
