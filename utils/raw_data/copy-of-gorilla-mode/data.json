    "Description": "With Gorilla Mode you can expect a massive increase in nitric oxide (NO) levels, intramuscular hydration, energy, focus and as significant of a boost in muscle strength and endurance as you can get from a legal non-hormonal pre-workout. This product is maxed out in the pump and performance category, as well as in the energy and focus category. It has a massive dose of L-Citrulline, GlycerPump, Agmatine, Creatine and Betaine to saturate your muscles with blood and intracellular hydration. It also has a potent stimulant complex comprised of a high dose of Caffeine and N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate. The high dosed Nootropics L-Tyrosine, Kanna and Huperzine A top off the cognitive enhancing component of Gorilla Mode and contribute to a significant increase in energy, focus and overall mental sharpness. Bioperine also potentiates the cognitive enhancing ingredients in this formula by prolonging their breakdown and increasing their bioavailability. Do not combine Gorilla Mode with Gorilla Mode Energy, a2 AM or Rauwolscine. ",
