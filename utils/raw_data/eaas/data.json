    "Description": "Essential Amino Acids (EAA’s) are required in order to build new muscle tissue and help with cell repair which occurs when muscles are recovering. They are essential because your body cannot produce them. EAA’s must come from your diet or supplementation. As such, we have created Gorilla Mode EAA’s, which like all of our products are turn-key and provide the optimal dosage required per day for each essential amino acid. Containing a total of 12 Grams of EAAs in 1 scoop it is the highest dosed EAA product in the industry.  Gorilla Mode EAA’s can be taken before, during, or after your workouts and will aid with muscle protein synthesis, muscle recovery and muscle building. We recommend mixing 1 scoop of Gorilla Mode EAA’s in 12-14 ounces of water but you can add or subtract water depending on your taste preference. The flavor for Gorilla Mode EAA’s is Mango Peach like Gorilla Mode and Gorilla Mode Nitric. We plan on adding more flavors in the near future.  ",
