    "Description": "cAMP PM - Named cAMP PM because one of the main vectors it works through is raising levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP), and it is most effectively used in the evening (PM) as your second dose to complement your morning α2 AM dose. cAMP PM has no stimulants so it shouldn't impair your sleep quality if taken in the early evening.  If you already take the max daily dose of our Gorilla Mode pre-workout, Gorilla Mode Energy pre-workout, or some other form of high stimulant intake, you'd be better off by using cAMP PM twice per day instead of α2 AM in the morning and cAMP PM in the evening.  This is only because you don't want to overdo the stims.   You can pair Rauwolscine with cAMP PM in the morning, or even with all of our Gorilla Mode pre-workouts if you want to drive adrenaline a bit harder and get more fat loss.  More elaborate dosing instructions are broken down on the product labels, but you can get pretty creative with the combinations to maximize fat loss and performance during your training sessions. ",
