    "Description": "Gorilla Mind Smooth is the best \"non-stimulant\" productivity supplement for those sensitive to caffeine. Focus without the jitters. Concentration without anxiety. Efficiency without the counter-productive crash. For those averse to caffeinated beverages, or stimulant-based products in general, this will be perfect for you. Gorilla Mind Smooth is our stimulant-free version of Gorilla Mind, providing a smoother, less extreme level of energy, but still maximizing the intense level of focus and heightened mental clarity that Gorilla Mind is renowned for. In general, you can expect clear headed mental clarity, as well as improved information retention, mood elevation, creativity, productivity and concentration. Gorilla Mind Smooth is not designed to jack your brain into high gear. Smooth is purely meant to enhance cognitive function and overall mental performance while enhancing your overall well-being.  Gorilla Mind Smooth can also double as pre-workout to give a big strength boost through the effects of acetylcholine. Recent formulas have worked very well at doing this but with further alterations to the formula there are more cholinergic agents at higher dosages. This increase in choline will help enhance the intracellular communication between the brain and nervous system, which is why it can be a great stack on top of your heavily dosed Gorilla Mode pre-workout for greater strength output.
