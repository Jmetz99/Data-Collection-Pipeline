    "Description": "Take your training to the next level with the hyper-hydrating effects of Glycerol Powder. Glycerol significantly enhances pumps and performance by hyper-hydrating the muscle with water. If you drink a lot of water with nothing else, the fall in osmolarity in your body stimulates the kidneys to remove most of the excess water within an hour. If you add glycerol to the water, this prevents the drop in osmolarity and can extend the hyper-hydration effect in your muscles by up to four hours. By adding Glycerol to your pre-workout, you can hold upwards of an extra liter of water via this hyper-hydrating effect. Hydration is one of the most critical factors when it comes to performance. Only a 2% loss in fluids can result in as much as a 20% decrease in exercise performance.",
