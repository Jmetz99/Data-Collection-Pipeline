    "Description": "After a hard training session the goal should be to replace what was lost during that session.   Your body mainly loses water, sodium and glycogen during a hard session, so that is what we would ideally replace as quickly as possible, followed by a low-fat meal with lean proteins shortly after.  Gorilla Mode Post-Workout is a mix of fast digesting carbs with very quick gastric emptying times, sodium, creatine and leucine.  Carbs: The Highly Branched Cyclic Dextrin (HBCD) is a very expensive carb source that has gained notoriety in the past decade not only for how well it works, but also for how well-tolerated it is.  In the past, carb powders designed to refill glycogen stores as quickly as possible essentially all fell short of their intended goal and caused significant amounts of bloating and gastrointestinal upset.  The slower the gastric emptying time and the more GI distress a carb source causes, the longer it will take for glycogen replenishment. HBCD is processed very quickly with no GI distress, and gets to the muscle to start the recovery process. ",
