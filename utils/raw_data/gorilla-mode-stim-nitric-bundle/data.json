    "Description": "Gorilla Mode Energy you can expect a very clean boost in mental clarity, productivity, focus and energy with this product. Gorilla Mode \"Stim\" contains a massive dose of carefully chosen synergistic stimulants and nootropics.  This product is designed specifically for energy and mental sharpness, so it does not contain any Nitric Oxide precursors, plasma expanders, or volumizing agents like Gorilla Mode and Gorilla Mode Nitric do.    With Gorilla Mode Nitric you can expect a massive increase in nitric oxide (NO) levels, vasodilation, intracellular hydration and as significant of a boost in muscle strength and endurance as you can get from a legal non-hormonal pre-workout. This product is maxed out from all angles. The traditional Arginine–eNOS–nitric oxide (NO) pathway is completely saturated with an unheard of dose of L-Citrulline, as well as topped out dosages of Nitrosigine and Agmatine Sulfate for good measure. Over a gram of nitrates also ensures that the nitrate–nitrite–nitric oxide (NO) pathway is taken care of.",
