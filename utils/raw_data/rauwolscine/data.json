    "Description": "Rauwolscine is a staple fat loss product for many people while dieting in order to maximize fat loss potential while maintaining steady energy levels and reducing those nasty cravings. You can expect: Appetite Suppression, increased fat loss and a boost of energy.  Rauwolscine works by inhibiting the alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the body. This will cause the body to release the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which can help prevent the creation of new fat tissue.  These Alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are very prominent in stubborn areas of the body like the inner thighs and abdominal areas, which makes the inhibition of those receptors very helpful during a diet. In addition, Rauwolscine can help during a diet by potentially reducing your appetite and increasing energy throughout the day. If you've dieted before, you'll know the biggest barriers are feeling hungry and lacking energy. In a calorie deficit, your body doesn't receive its usual amount of food resulting in lower energy and the release of the hunger hormone, ghrelin. Combat this with Rauwolscine during your next cut or diet. ",
