    "Description": "This formula hits various vectors to address suboptimal nutrient and mineral intake, insufficient gonadotropin output, steroidogenesis in the testis, binding protein interactions, and even stress management to support a more conducive state to maxed out natural Testosterone output.  Far too many people jump the gun and begin to administer exogenous hormones before exploring all the ways they could support their endocrine system via the basics like sleep hygiene, diet, exercise, stress reduction, etc. This product is not a substitute for those basics in any capacity, but it can be a potent adjunct to help support higher Testosterone levels and overall fertility metrics. For a deep dive into the formula, check out Derekâ€™s 2+ hour breakdown (with timestamps in the pinned comment), where he talks with Andrew Huberman, dissects the clinical studies, efficacy data, side effect profiles, and provides a comprehensive overview of who this formula is best suited for and what to expect from it: Sigma - A Comprehensive Overview Of Testosterone Boosting Supplements That Actually Work Suggested Use: ",
